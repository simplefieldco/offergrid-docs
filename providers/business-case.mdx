## The Opportunity

Property management software (PMS) providers are becoming a major sales channel for service providers. But this channel introduces a new cost layer: PMS providers generate the leads, then pass them to brokers who submit orders and collect commissions.

**What if 80% of these orders went directly to you?**

Orders that don't require human intervention—no exceptions, no special handling—can be submitted via API directly from the PMS originator, bypassing the broker entirely.

## The Math (Hypothetical)

| Cost Component | Current Model | With Offergrid |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Offergrid Platform | $0 | $25 |
| Broker Commission | $250 | $0 |
| PMS Commission | $250 | $250 |
| PMC Commission | $250 | $250 |
| **Total per Order** | **$750** | **$525** |

**Estimated Savings: $225 per API order**

At scale, a major provider processing thousands of PMS-originated orders monthly could reduce fulfillment costs by $500K+ per month.

## How Offergrid Works

1. **You publish offers** — pricing, availability, marketing assets, and compliance requirements stored in one place
2. **PMS partners access your catalog** — approved resellers get real-time offer data via API or dashboard (millisecond access)
3. **Orders come direct** — API-ready orders submit directly to you; complex orders still route through brokers
4. **You control access** — decide which partners see which offers, set submission rules per market or reseller

## What Makes This Different

- **Not a broker**: Offergrid doesn't sell services or take order commissions like Red Ventures
- **Not a master broker**: Unlike DSI or Perfect Vision, Offergrid manages data relationships, not business relationships
- **One integration**: Connect once, then add partners through your dashboard—no additional dev work per partner
