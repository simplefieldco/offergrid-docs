## Pricing Types

Offergrid supports four pricing models to match your business needs:

## Fixed Pricing

**Type**: `fixed`

A simple, predictable monthly price that doesn't change based on usage or customer characteristics.

**Best for**:
- Standard service packages
- Simple offerings with consistent costs
- When you want predictable revenue

**Example**:

```json
{
  "pricingType": "fixed",
  "monthlyPrice": 59.99
}
```

**Use case**: "High-Speed Internet 1000 Mbps for $59.99/month"

## Variable Pricing

**Type**: `variable`

Pricing that changes based on usage, customer characteristics, or market conditions.

**Best for**:
- Usage-based services (energy, metered internet)
- Services with fluctuating costs
- Custom quotes per customer

**Example**:

```json
{
  "pricingType": "variable",
  "monthlyPrice": null,
  "description": "Pricing varies based on usage. Estimated $0.12 per kWh."
}
```

**Use case**: Energy plans with per-kWh pricing

<Note>
  For variable pricing, use the `description` field to explain how pricing is calculated. The `monthlyPrice` can be `null` or an estimated average.
</Note>

## Tiered Pricing

**Type**: `tiered`

Different price points based on service level, volume, or features.

**Best for**:
- Multiple service tiers (Good/Better/Best)
- Volume-based pricing
- Feature-differentiated packages

**Example**:

```json
{
  "pricingType": "tiered",
  "monthlyPrice": 99.99,
  "description": "Premium tier. Basic: $49.99, Standard: $79.99, Premium: $99.99",
  "metadata": {
    "tier": "premium",
    "tiers": [
      { "name": "Basic", "price": 49.99 },
      { "name": "Standard", "price": 79.99 },
      { "name": "Premium", "price": 99.99 }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Use case**: Internet plans at 100 Mbps, 500 Mbps, and 1000 Mbps speeds

## Custom Pricing

**Type**: `custom`

Completely custom pricing requiring quotes, negotiations, or complex calculations.

**Best for**:
- Enterprise services
- Complex bundled offerings
- Services requiring site surveys or assessments

**Example**:

```json
{
  "pricingType": "custom",
  "monthlyPrice": null,
  "description": "Contact for custom quote. Pricing based on property size and required coverage."
}
```

**Use case**: Commercial security systems, enterprise energy contracts

## Additional Fees

Beyond monthly pricing, include other costs in your offer:

### One-Time Fees

- **Installation/Setup**: `installationFee`
- **Equipment**: `equipmentFee`
- **Activation**: `activationFee`
- **Deposit**: `depositRequired`

### Recurring Add-Ons

- **Equipment Rental**: Monthly router/modem fees
- **Premium Features**: Enhanced support, extra services
- **Overage Charges**: Usage beyond included limits

**Example with fees**:

```json
{
  "name": "Professional Security System",
  "monthlyPrice": 49.99,
  "pricingType": "fixed",
  "metadata": {
    "installationFee": 199.00,
    "equipmentFee": 0,
    "contractLength": "36 months",
    "earlyTerminationFee": 300.00
  }
}
```

## Promotional Pricing

Use the `metadata` field to track promotional pricing:

```json
{
  "monthlyPrice": 39.99,
  "metadata": {
    "regularPrice": 59.99,
    "promotionalPeriod": "First 12 months",
    "promoEndDate": "2025-12-31"
  },
  "marketingHeadline": "Special offer: $39.99/mo for the first year!"
}
```

## Pricing Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be transparent about all costs">
    Include ALL fees upfront—installation, equipment, activation, early termination. Hidden fees create friction and reduce conversion.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use clear pricing descriptions">
    Explain what's included and what costs extra. Make it easy for resellers to quote customers accurately.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep pricing current">
    Update offers promptly when pricing changes. Outdated pricing leads to order failures and unhappy customers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Highlight promotional offers">
    Use the `marketingHeadline` and `marketingDescription` fields to showcase special pricing clearly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consider competitor pricing">
    Research market rates for similar services. Competitive pricing helps resellers choose your offers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test different price points">
    Create multiple offers at different price points to see what resonates with resellers and customers.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Regional Pricing

If you need different pricing by region:

1. Create separate offers for each region
2. Use `internalName` to track variations (e.g., "Internet-1000-West", "Internet-1000-East")
3. Set appropriate availability zones for each

**Example**:

```json
// West Coast offer
{
  "name": "Gigabit Internet",
  "internalName": "Gigabit-West",
  "monthlyPrice": 79.99,
  "metadata": { "region": "West" }
}

// East Coast offer
{
  "name": "Gigabit Internet",
  "internalName": "Gigabit-East",
  "monthlyPrice": 69.99,
  "metadata": { "region": "East" }
}
```
