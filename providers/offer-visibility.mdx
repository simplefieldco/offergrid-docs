## Overview

OfferGrid gives you complete control over who can see and order your service offerings. Choose from public visibility, preferred partners, or selected resellers.

## Visibility Options

### Public Access

**Who can see**: All verified resellers on the platform

**Best for**:
- Maximizing distribution reach
- Commoditized services with standard pricing
- Building brand awareness
- Growing your partner network

**How to enable**:

Set the visibility to public when creating or updating an offer:

```json
{
  "name": "High-Speed Internet",
  "status": "active",
  "visibility": "public"
}
```

<Tip>
  Public visibility is the default setting for new offers. Simply publish an offer with `status: "active"` to make it available to all resellers.
</Tip>

### Preferred Partners

**Who can see**: Only resellers you've added to your preferred partner list

**Best for**:
- Premium services with special pricing
- Partners who meet quality standards
- Maintaining service quality control
- Relationship-based distribution

**How to enable**:

1. Build your preferred partner list in the dashboard or via API
2. Set offer visibility to `preferred`:

```json
{
  "name": "Premium Service Package",
  "status": "active",
  "visibility": "preferred"
}
```

All resellers on your preferred list will be able to see and order this offer.

### Selected Resellers

**Who can see**: Specific resellers you choose for this offer

**Best for**:
- Exclusive partnerships
- Market testing with select partners
- Custom or negotiated offerings
- Regional exclusives

**How to enable**:

Specify which reseller teams can access the offer:

```json
{
  "name": "Exclusive Regional Offer",
  "status": "active",
  "visibility": "selected",
  "allowedResellers": [
    "reseller-team-id-1",
    "reseller-team-id-2"
  ]
}
```

<Note>
  Only the resellers with matching team IDs will see this offer in their catalog.
</Note>

## Managing Partner Lists

### Adding Preferred Partners

Via dashboard:
1. Go to **Partners** → **Preferred Resellers**
2. Click **Add Partner**
3. Search for reseller by name or ID
4. Click **Add to Preferred List**

Via API:
```json
POST /provider/partners/preferred
{
  "resellerTeamId": "team-xyz-123"
}
```

### Removing Partners

Remove partners from your preferred list:

```json
DELETE /provider/partners/preferred/{resellerTeamId}
```

Removed partners will immediately lose access to your preferred-only offers.

## Offer Status vs. Visibility

Understand the difference:

| Status | Visibility | Result |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `draft` | Any | **Hidden** from all resellers |
| `active` | `public` | **Visible** to all verified resellers |
| `active` | `preferred` | **Visible** to preferred partners only |
| `active` | `selected` | **Visible** to specified resellers only |
| `inactive` | Any | **Hidden** from all resellers |
| `archived` | Any | **Permanently hidden** |

<Warning>
  An offer must have `status: "active"` AND appropriate visibility settings to be seen by resellers. Draft and inactive offers are never visible regardless of visibility settings.
</Warning>

## Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Launch a New Service

**Goal**: Test with trusted partners before broad release

**Strategy**:
1. Create offer with `visibility: "selected"`
2. Add 3-5 high-performing resellers
3. Monitor performance and feedback
4. Expand to `visibility: "preferred"` after validation
5. Eventually go `visibility: "public"`

### Scenario 2: Regional Exclusives

**Goal**: Grant exclusive rights to one reseller per region

**Strategy**:
1. Create separate offers for each region
2. Use `visibility: "selected"` for each
3. Assign one reseller per region offer
4. Track performance and adjust as needed

### Scenario 3: Tiered Partner Program

**Goal**: Reward top performers with exclusive offers

**Strategy**:
1. Standard offers: `visibility: "public"`
2. Enhanced offers: `visibility: "preferred"`
3. Premium offers: `visibility: "selected"` for top tier only
4. Promote resellers between tiers based on performance

### Scenario 4: Negotiated Pricing

**Goal**: Offer custom pricing to specific partners

**Strategy**:
1. Create custom offer for partner
2. Set `visibility: "selected"`
3. Add only that partner's team ID
4. Use clear `internalName` for tracking (e.g., "Internet-Partner-XYZ-Special")
