### Via API

Create an offer programmatically using the Provider API:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.offergrid.io/provider/offers \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "High-Speed Internet 1000 Mbps",
    "category": "internet",
    "status": "active",
    "monthlyPrice": 59.99,
    "description": "Blazing fast fiber internet with unlimited data",
    "keyFeatures": [
      "1000 Mbps download",
      "1000 Mbps upload",
      "Unlimited data",
      "No contract required"
    ],
    "serviceSpecificData": {
      "downloadSpeed": "1000 Mbps",
      "uploadSpeed": "1000 Mbps",
      "connectionType": "Fiber"
    }
  }'
```

```typescript TypeScript
const response = await fetch('https://api.offergrid.io/provider/offers', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'x-api-key': process.env.OFFERGRID_API_KEY,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'High-Speed Internet 1000 Mbps',
    category: 'internet',
    status: 'active',
    monthlyPrice: 59.99,
    description: 'Blazing fast fiber internet with unlimited data',
    keyFeatures: [
      '1000 Mbps download',
      '1000 Mbps upload',
      'Unlimited data',
      'No contract required',

      uploadSpeed: '1000 Mbps',

const offer = await response.json();
```
