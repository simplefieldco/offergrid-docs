## Overview

Preferred reseller programs let you reward top-performing partners with exclusive benefits while maintaining quality control over who can access your services.

## Why Create a Preferred Program?

### Benefits for Providers

- **Quality control**: Work with partners who meet your standards
- **Better margins**: Reduce costs by working with efficient partners
- **Predictable volume**: Build recurring business with known partners
- **Competitive advantage**: Attract top resellers with exclusive offerings

### Benefits for Resellers

- **Exclusive access**: Services not available to general public
- **Better pricing**: Improved margins on premium offers
- **Priority support**: Faster response times, dedicated contacts
- **Early access**: New services before broad launch

## Setting Up Your Program

### Step 1: Define Criteria

Decide what makes a reseller "preferred":

**Quantitative metrics**:
- Minimum monthly order volume (e.g., 10+ orders/month)
- Acceptance rate threshold (e.g., 90%+)
- Completion rate (e.g., 95%+)
- Customer satisfaction score (e.g., 4.5+ stars)
- Tenure on platform (e.g., 3+ months)

**Qualitative factors**:
- Industry expertise
- Geographic coverage
- Target customer segments
- Brand alignment
- Communication quality

<Tip>
  Start with objective metrics first. Add subjective criteria only for strategic partnerships.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Identify Candidates

Review existing resellers against your criteria:

```sql
-- Example query for identifying candidates
SELECT
  reseller_id,
  COUNT(*) as total_orders,
  AVG(acceptance_rate) as avg_acceptance,
  AVG(completion_rate) as avg_completion,
  AVG(customer_rating) as avg_rating
FROM orders
WHERE created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 90 DAY)
GROUP BY reseller_id
HAVING total_orders >= 10
  AND avg_acceptance >= 0.90
  AND avg_completion >= 0.95
  AND avg_rating >= 4.5
ORDER BY total_orders DESC;
```

### Step 3: Add to Preferred List

Via API:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.offergrid.io/provider/partners/preferred" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "resellerTeamId": "team-abc-123",
    "tier": "preferred",
    "effectiveDate": "2025-01-01",
    "notes": "High-volume partner with excellent completion rates"
  }'
```

Via Dashboard:
1. Navigate to **Partners** → **Preferred Resellers**
2. Click **Add Partner**
3. Search for reseller by name or ID
4. Add notes about why they qualify
5. Click **Add to List**

### Step 4: Create Preferred Offers

Create offers visible only to preferred partners:

```json
{
  "name": "Premium Business Internet - Preferred Partner Pricing",
  "category": "internet",
  "status": "active",
  "visibility": "preferred",
  "monthlyPrice": 74.99,
  "internalName": "Bus-Internet-Preferred",
  "description": "Special pricing for preferred partners only"
}
```

## Program Tiers

Many providers use multi-tier programs:

### Single Tier: Preferred

**Simple approach**: You're either preferred or you're not.

**Benefits**:
- Easy to understand
- Simple to manage
- Clear entry criteria

**Example**:
- **Standard**: Public offers at regular pricing
- **Preferred**: Exclusive offers with 10% better pricing

### Multi-Tier: Bronze/Silver/Gold

**Graduated approach**: Multiple levels with increasing benefits.

**Benefits**:
- Motivates progression
- Rewards top performers more
- Flexibility in partnerships

**Example tiers**:

```
Bronze (All resellers):
- Public offers
- Standard pricing
- Standard support

Silver (10+ orders/month, 90%+ completion):
- Silver-exclusive offers
- 5% better pricing
- Priority support

Gold (50+ orders/month, 95%+ completion):
- Gold-exclusive offers
- 10% better pricing
- Dedicated account manager
- Co-marketing opportunities
```

### Adding Partners

Notify partners when adding them:

```

```

### Removing Partners

If a partner falls below standards:

1. **Warning**: Notify them they're at risk
2. **Grace period**: Give 30-60 days to improve
3. **Removal**: Remove from list if no improvement
4. **Communication**: Explain why and how to regain status

```bash
# Remove from preferred list
curl -X DELETE "https://api.offergrid.io/provider/partners/preferred/team-abc-123" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```
