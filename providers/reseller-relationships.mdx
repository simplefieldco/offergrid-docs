## Overview

Strong reseller partnerships drive sustained growth. Offergrid gives you tools to identify, nurture, and manage relationships with your distribution partners.

## Types of Reseller Partnerships

### Public Distribution

**Who**: All verified resellers on Offergrid

**Best for**:
- Maximizing order volume
- Brand awareness
- Standard commodity services
- Expanding market reach

**Management**: Minimal required. Monitor order quality and address issues as they arise.

### Preferred Partners

**Who**: Resellers who meet your quality and performance standards

**Best for**:
- Mid-tier services requiring some expertise
- Partners who consistently deliver
- Building recurring business
- Balancing reach and quality

**Management**: Regular performance reviews, periodic communication, special pricing or incentives.

### Strategic Partners

**Who**: Top-performing resellers with exclusive access

**Best for**:
- Premium or complex services
- High-value contracts
- Regional exclusives
- Long-term commitments

**Management**: Dedicated account managers, custom pricing, co-marketing, quarterly business reviews.

## Building Your Partner Network

### Step 1: Start Broad

Launch with public offers to:
- Discover which resellers are interested
- Test market demand
- Identify high performers

Monitor early orders to see who's sending quality business.

### Step 2: Identify Top Performers

Track metrics like:
- **Order volume**: Total orders per month
- **Order quality**: Acceptance rate, completion rate
- **Customer satisfaction**: Feedback from end customers
- **Response time**: How quickly they respond to issues

### Step 3: Create Preferred Tier

Move top performers to a preferred partner list:

```bash
POST /provider/partners/preferred
{
  "resellerTeamId": "team-abc-123",
  "tier": "preferred",
  "notes": "High-volume partner with 95% completion rate"
}
```

Give preferred partners:
- Access to exclusive offers
- Better pricing
- Priority support
- Early access to new services

### Step 4: Develop Strategic Partnerships

For your very best partners:
- Create custom offers with negotiated pricing
- Use `visibility: "selected"` for exclusive access
- Provide dedicated support contacts
- Collaborate on marketing

## Partner Communication

### Regular Check-Ins

**Monthly** (preferred partners):
- Review order metrics
- Discuss upcoming services
- Address any issues
- Share market insights

**Quarterly** (strategic partners):
- Formal business reviews
- Performance scorecards
- Planning for next quarter
- Contract renewals or adjustments

### Proactive Updates

Notify partners when:
- New services launch
- Pricing changes
- Service area expansions
- Promotional offers available
- Platform updates or downtime

### Feedback Loops

Ask for input on:
- What services they need
- Which ZIP codes have high demand
- Competitive offerings
- Process improvements

## Performance Tracking

Monitor these partner metrics:

### Order Metrics

- **Total orders**: Volume over time
- **Acceptance rate**: % of their orders you accept
- **Completion rate**: % successfully fulfilled
- **Average order value**: Revenue per order

### Quality Metrics

- **Customer satisfaction**: End-customer feedback
- **Cancellation rate**: Orders cancelled before completion
- **Address accuracy**: Quality of customer information
- **Response time**: Speed of partner communication

### Growth Metrics

- **Month-over-month growth**: Order volume trends
- **New vs. repeat**: Customer acquisition patterns
- **Service mix**: Which services they prefer

## Partner Tiers & Incentives

## Managing Problem Partners

### Address Issues Early

If a partner has:
- High cancellation rates
- Poor address quality
- Customer complaints
- Slow response times

**Action**: Reach out proactively to discuss and resolve.

### Progressive Response

1. **First issue**: Friendly email or call to understand what happened
2. **Repeat issues**: Formal conversation about expectations
3. **Ongoing problems**: Remove from preferred list
4. **Serious violations**: Block access to specific or all offers

### Documentation

Keep notes on partner interactions:

```json
{
  "resellerTeamId": "team-xyz-789",
  "tier": "silver",
  "notes": [
    {
      "date": "2025-01-15",
      "type": "performance_review",
      "summary": "Discussed high cancellation rate (18%). Partner implementing new address validation process."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Exclusive Partnerships

### Regional Exclusives

Grant one partner exclusive rights in a region:

1. Create region-specific offer
2. Set `visibility: "selected"`
3. Add only that partner
4. Define performance requirements
5. Set review period (quarterly or annually)

**Example agreement terms**:
- Minimum monthly volume (20 orders)
- Performance standards (95% completion rate)
- Contract term (12 months)
- Renewal criteria

### Service Exclusives

Give a partner exclusive rights to a specific service type:

```json
{
  "name": "Premium Business Internet",
  "visibility": "selected",
  "allowedResellers": ["partner-abc-123"],
  "metadata": {
    "exclusiveUntil": "2025-12-31",
    "minimumMonthlyOrders": 15
  }
}
```
