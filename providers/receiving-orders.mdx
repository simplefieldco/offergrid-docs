## Overview

When resellers place orders for your services, you'll receive structured order data with all the information needed to fulfill the customer request.

## How You Receive Orders

### Dashboard Notifications

View all incoming orders in your provider dashboard:

1. Navigate to **Orders** in the sidebar
2. See new orders marked as `pending` or `submitted_to_provider`
3. Click on an order to view full details
4. Take action (accept, reject, schedule)

### API Polling

Retrieve orders programmatically:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.offergrid.io/provider/orders?status=pending" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Filter by status to get orders that need attention:
- `pending` - Newly submitted, awaiting acceptance
- `submitted_to_provider` - Sent to your fulfillment system
- `accepted` - Accepted and in progress

### Webhook Notifications

Set up webhooks to receive real-time notifications when new orders arrive:

```json
{
  "event": "order.created",
  "orderId": "ord-123-abc",
  "itemId": "item-456-def",
  "offerId": "off-789-ghi",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-02T10:00:00Z"
}
```

See [Webhooks](/providers/webhooks) for setup instructions.

## Order Structure

Each order contains:

### Order Item Details

```json
{
  "id": "item-456-def",
  "orderId": "ord-123-abc",
  "offerId": "off-789-ghi",
  "offerName": "High-Speed Internet 1000 Mbps",
  "status": "pending",
  "createdAt": "2025-01-02T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### Customer Information

```json
{
  "customerInfo": {
    "fullName": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "phone": "+1-555-123-4567"
  }
}
```

### Service Address

```json
{
  "serviceAddress": {
    "street": "123 Main St",
    "city": "San Francisco",
    "state": "CA",
    "zipCode": "94102",
    "country": "US"
  }
}
```

### Additional Details

```json
{
  "notes": "Customer prefers afternoon installations",
  "metadata": {
    "referralSource": "property-listing",
    "unitNumber": "4B",
    "moveInDate": "2025-01-15"
  }
}
```

## Order Workflow

When you receive an order:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Order Details">
    Check customer information, service address, and any special notes from the reseller
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Availability">
    Confirm that the service is available at the customer's location
  </Step>

  <Step title="Accept or Reject">
    Update the order status to `accepted` if you can fulfill it, or `rejected` if not
  </Step>

  <Step title="Schedule Fulfillment">
    If accepted, schedule installation or activation and update status to `scheduled`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete Installation">
    After successful installation, update status to `completed` or `active`
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Accepting Orders

To accept an order:

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://api.offergrid.io/provider/orders/ITEM_ID/status" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "status": "accepted",
    "providerNotes": "Order accepted. We will contact customer to schedule installation."
  }'
```

<Tip>
  Include helpful notes in `providerNotes` to keep resellers informed about next steps.
</Tip>

## Rejecting Orders

If you cannot fulfill an order, reject it with a clear reason:

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://api.offergrid.io/provider/orders/ITEM_ID/status" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "status": "rejected",
    "providerNotes": "Service not available at this address. Building does not have fiber infrastructure."
  }'
```

Common rejection reasons:
- Service not available at location
- Address outside service area
- Technical limitations (building wiring, line of sight)
- Credit check failure
- Duplicate order

## Order Filtering

Filter orders by status to focus on what needs attention:

```bash
# Get pending orders
GET /provider/orders?status=pending

# Get orders needing scheduling
GET /provider/orders?status=accepted

# Get active services
GET /provider/orders?status=active
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Respond quickly">
    Accept or reject orders within 24 hours. Fast response times improve reseller satisfaction and customer experience.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Verify addresses carefully">
    Double-check service addresses before accepting. Address errors are a common cause of fulfillment delays.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Provide clear rejection reasons">
    When rejecting, explain why so resellers can address issues or find alternative solutions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Include next steps">
    When accepting, tell resellers what happens next and when to expect follow-up.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set up automated notifications">
    Use webhooks to integrate orders into your fulfillment systems automatically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor order volume">
    Track incoming order patterns to forecast capacity needs and staffing.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Automated Order Processing

For high-volume providers, consider automating order acceptance:

```typescript
// Example: Auto-accept if service is available
async function processNewOrder(orderId: string) {
  const order = await getOrderDetails(orderId);
  const available = await checkServiceAvailability(order.serviceAddress);

  if (available) {
    await updateOrderStatus(orderId, {
      status: 'accepted',
      providerNotes: 'Auto-accepted. Customer will be contacted within 24 hours.',
    });

    // Trigger internal fulfillment workflow
    await scheduleInstallation(order);
  } else {
    await updateOrderStatus(orderId, {
      status: 'rejected',
      providerNotes: 'Service not available at this location.',
    });
  }
}
```
