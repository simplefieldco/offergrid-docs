## How It Works

### 1. Publish Service Offers

Create detailed service offerings including:
- Service name and category (internet, TV, security, energy, insurance)
- Pricing (fixed, variable, or tiered)
- Service specifications (speeds, channels, coverage)
- Availability by ZIP code or region
- Marketing content and images

### 2. Manage Partner Access

Control offer visibility:
- **Public**: All verified resellers can see and order
- **Preferred Partners**: Only your approved reseller list
- **Selected Resellers**: Specific partners you choose

### 3. Receive and Fulfill Orders

When resellers place orders:
- Get instant notification with customer details
- Accept or reject based on availability
- Update status through the fulfillment workflow
- Keep resellers informed with automated notifications
