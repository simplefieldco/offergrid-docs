## Order Status Lifecycle

Orders progress through several states from initial submission to completion:

```
pending → submitted_to_provider → accepted → scheduled →
in_progress → completed → active
```

Or, if something goes wrong:

```
pending → rejected
accepted → cancelled
in_progress → failed
```

## Status Definitions

### Initial States

**`pending`**
- Order just created by reseller
- Awaiting provider review
- **Your action**: Review and accept or reject

**`submitted_to_provider`**
- Order sent to your fulfillment system
- Awaiting confirmation
- **Your action**: Confirm receipt and accept or reject

### Accepted States

**`accepted`**
- You've confirmed you can fulfill the order
- Customer info verified
- **Your action**: Schedule installation or activation

**`scheduled`**
- Installation or activation date set
- Customer has been contacted
- **Your action**: Complete the installation on schedule

**`in_progress`**
- Installation or setup actively happening
- Technician on-site or service being activated
- **Your action**: Complete installation and activate service

### Completion States

**`completed`**
- Installation finished successfully
- Service activated and tested
- **Your action**: None (terminal state)

**`active`**
- Service is live and active
- Ongoing service subscription
- **Your action**: Monitor for issues, provide support

### Failure States

**`rejected`**
- Unable to fulfill the order
- Clear reason provided
- **Your action**: None (terminal state)

**`cancelled`**
- Order cancelled after acceptance
- By provider or reseller request
- **Your action**: None (terminal state)

**`failed`**
- Installation or activation failed
- Technical or logistical issues
- **Your action**: Document reason, coordinate with reseller on resolution

## Updating Order Status

### Via API

Update order item status with a PATCH request:

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://api.offergrid.io/provider/orders/ITEM_ID/status" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "status": "scheduled",
    "providerNotes": "Installation scheduled for Tuesday, Jan 15 between 1-5 PM",
    "scheduledFor": "2025-01-15T13:00:00Z",
    "metadata": {
      "technicianName": "Mike Johnson",
      "technicianPhone": "+1-555-999-8888"
    }
  }'
```

### Required vs. Optional Fields

**Always required**:
- `status` - The new status value

**Recommended**:
- `providerNotes` - Human-readable update for reseller
- `scheduledFor` - When status is `scheduled`
- `metadata` - Additional context (tracking numbers, appointment details)

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Standard Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Order received">
    Status: `pending`

    Action: Review order details and verify service availability
  </Step>

  <Step title="Accept order">
    Status: `accepted`

    ```json
    {
      "status": "accepted",
      "providerNotes": "Order accepted. Customer will be contacted within 24 hours to schedule installation."
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Schedule installation">
    Status: `scheduled`

    ```json
    {
      "status": "scheduled",
      "providerNotes": "Installation scheduled for Jan 15, 1-5 PM",
      "scheduledFor": "2025-01-15T13:00:00Z",
      "metadata": {
        "appointmentWindow": "1-5 PM",
        "technicianName": "Mike Johnson"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Begin installation">
    Status: `in_progress`

    ```json
    {
      "status": "in_progress",
      "providerNotes": "Technician on-site, installation in progress"
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete installation">
    Status: `completed` or `active`

    ```json
    {
      "status": "active",
      "providerNotes": "Service activated successfully. Customer account #12345",
      "metadata": {
        "accountNumber": "12345",
        "activationDate": "2025-01-15"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Workflow 2: Instant Activation (No Installation)

For services that don't require physical installation:

```
pending → accepted → active
```

Example (insurance, some energy plans):

```json
{
  "status": "active",
  "providerNotes": "Policy activated immediately. Policy #POL-98765",
  "metadata": {
    "policyNumber": "POL-98765",
    "effectiveDate": "2025-01-02"
  }
}
```

### Workflow 3: Rejection

If you cannot fulfill:

```json
{
  "status": "rejected",
  "providerNotes": "Service not available at this address. Building does not have fiber infrastructure. Cable internet available as alternative."
}
```

### Workflow 4: Cancellation After Acceptance

If an accepted order must be cancelled:

```json
{
  "status": "cancelled",
  "providerNotes": "Customer requested cancellation before installation. No fees charged."
}
```

## Status Update Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Update status promptly">
    Update within hours of status changes, not days. Real-time updates build trust with resellers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Always include notes">
    Use `providerNotes` to explain what happened and what happens next. Resellers relay this info to customers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Provide scheduling details">
    When setting status to `scheduled`, always include the date/time and appointment window.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Include reference numbers">
    Add account numbers, work order IDs, or tracking numbers in `metadata` for future reference.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Be specific about failures">
    If rejecting or failing an order, clearly explain why and suggest alternatives when possible.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use metadata for automation">
    Structure `metadata` consistently so resellers can parse and use it programmatically.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Automated Status Updates

Integrate OfferGrid status updates into your existing systems:

```typescript
// Example: Update status when your CRM changes
async function onInstallationScheduled(workOrder) {
  await fetch(`https://api.offergrid.io/provider/orders/${workOrder.offergridItemId}/status`, {
    method: 'PATCH',
    headers: {
      'x-api-key': process.env.OFFERGRID_API_KEY,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      status: 'scheduled',
      providerNotes: `Installation scheduled for ${workOrder.appointmentDate}`,
      scheduledFor: workOrder.appointmentDate,
      metadata: {
        workOrderId: workOrder.id,
        technicianId: workOrder.technicianId,
      },
    }),
  });
}
```

## Monitoring Order Progress

Track order metrics in your dashboard:

- **Acceptance rate**: % of orders accepted vs. rejected
- **Time to accept**: How quickly you respond to new orders
- **Completion rate**: % of accepted orders successfully completed
- **Average fulfillment time**: Days from acceptance to activation
