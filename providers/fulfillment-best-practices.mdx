## Overview

Successful fulfillment leads to happy customers, satisfied resellers, and more business. Follow these best practices to streamline your operations and maximize success rates.

## Response Time

### Accept/Reject Within 24 Hours

<Check>**Target**: Respond to new orders within 2-4 hours</Check>

Fast response times:
- Show resellers you're reliable
- Keep customers engaged and excited
- Reduce order cancellations
- Improve your provider rating

Set up automated notifications to alert your team immediately when orders arrive.

### Communicate Delays Promptly

If you can't respond quickly:
- Update order status with a note
- Set expectations for when you'll have an answer
- Don't leave orders in `pending` for days

```json
{
  "status": "submitted_to_provider",
  "providerNotes": "Order received. Address verification in progress, will update within 24 hours."
}
```

## Address Verification

### Always Verify Service Availability

Before accepting an order:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check address format">
    Ensure street, city, state, ZIP are complete and valid
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify serviceability">
    Confirm your service is available at that specific address
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check for restrictions">
    Look for HOA restrictions, building policies, or other blockers
  </Step>

  <Step title="Validate unit numbers">
    For apartments/condos, ensure unit number is correct
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Common Address Issues

Watch out for:
- **Incorrect ZIP codes**: Verify ZIP matches city/state
- **Missing unit numbers**: Apartment orders without unit info
- **Ambiguous addresses**: "123 Main Street" exists in multiple cities
- **New construction**: Addresses not yet in your system
- **Rural routes**: Non-standard address formats

<Tip>
  When in doubt, contact the reseller to clarify address details before rejecting. They can often provide additional context.
</Tip>

## Scheduling & Communication

### Contact Customers Promptly

After accepting an order:
- Contact customer within 24-48 hours
- Offer multiple scheduling options
- Confirm contact information
- Set clear expectations

### Provide Scheduling Details

When setting `status: "scheduled"`, include:

```json
{
  "status": "scheduled",
  "scheduledFor": "2025-01-15T13:00:00Z",
  "providerNotes": "Installation scheduled for Tuesday, Jan 15, 1-5 PM. Technician Mike Johnson will call 30 minutes before arrival.",
  "metadata": {
    "appointmentWindow": "1-5 PM",
    "technicianName": "Mike Johnson",
    "technicianPhone": "+1-555-999-8888",
    "confirmationNumber": "CONF-12345"
  }
}
```

### Send Reminders

- 48 hours before appointment
- 24 hours before appointment
- 30 minutes before technician arrival

## Installation Quality

### Arrive On Time

- Honor appointment windows strictly
- Call if running late
- Update order status if delays occur

### Complete Work Properly

- Test all services before leaving
- Verify customer satisfaction
- Leave premises clean and organized
- Provide account details and documentation

### Update Status Accurately

```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "providerNotes": "Installation completed successfully. All services tested and operational. Customer account #12345 active.",
  "metadata": {
    "accountNumber": "12345",
    "completedDate": "2025-01-15",
    "technicianId": "TECH-789"
  }
}
```

## Rejection Management

### Be Specific About Reasons

Don't just reject—explain why:

<CodeGroup>

```json Bad Example
{
  "status": "rejected",
  "providerNotes": "Cannot fulfill order."
}
```

```json Good Example
{
  "status": "rejected",
  "providerNotes": "Service not available at this address. The building does not have fiber infrastructure. Cable internet up to 500 Mbps is available as an alternative. Contact us for details."
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Suggest Alternatives

When rejecting, help resellers find solutions:
- Recommend alternative services you offer
- Suggest what's possible (if fiber isn't available, mention cable)
- Provide contact info for special cases

### Common Rejection Reasons

Track and address frequent issues:
- **"Service area"**: Expand coverage or clarify boundaries
- **"Technical limitations"**: Document building requirements
- **"Duplicate order"**: Improve deduplication process
- **"Credit check"**: Clarify credit requirements upfront

## Performance Metrics

Monitor these key indicators:

### Acceptance Rate

**Target**: > 85%

Low acceptance rates indicate:
- Offers listed in wrong service areas
- Unclear offer descriptions
- Technical limitations not documented

### Time to Schedule

**Target**: < 5 days from acceptance

Customers expect quick scheduling. Long delays lead to cancellations.

### Completion Rate

**Target**: > 95%

High failure rates suggest:
- Poor address verification
- Scheduling issues
- Technical problems

### Customer Satisfaction

**Target**: 4.5+ stars

Track feedback from resellers about customer experience.

## Automation Strategies

### Auto-Accept Where Possible

For standardized services with clear availability:

```typescript
async function autoAcceptIfAvailable(order) {
  const isServiceable = await checkServiceAvailability(order.serviceAddress);

  if (isServiceable && order.offer.category === 'internet') {
    await updateOrderStatus(order.itemId, {
      status: 'accepted',
      providerNotes: 'Order auto-accepted. Customer will be contacted within 24 hours.',
    });

    await scheduleCustomerContact(order);
  }
}
```

### Integrate with CRM/Scheduling

Connect Offergrid to your existing systems:
- Import orders automatically
- Sync appointment scheduling
- Update order status from your fulfillment system
- Generate work orders automatically

### Set Up Webhooks

Receive instant notifications:
- New orders arrive
- Reseller cancels order
- Status updates needed

See [Webhooks](/providers/webhooks) for details.

## Communication Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep resellers informed">
    Use `providerNotes` to communicate clearly. Resellers relay updates to customers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Be proactive about issues">
    If something goes wrong, update status immediately and explain what happened.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Provide contact information">
    Include phone numbers or email for customer questions about their specific order.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use consistent formats">
    Structure `metadata` the same way every time so resellers can parse it programmatically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Acknowledge special requests">
    If reseller includes notes (preferred contact times, specific instructions), acknowledge them in your response.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Handling Edge Cases

### Duplicate Orders

If a customer already has service:
```json
{
  "status": "rejected",
  "providerNotes": "Customer already has active service. Account #12345. Contact customer care to modify existing service."
}
```

### Address Outside Service Area

Reject with specific boundary information:
```json
{
  "status": "rejected",
  "providerNotes": "Address is 0.3 miles outside our service area. We service ZIP codes 94101-94110. Contact us if service area expands."
}
```

### Technical Installation Issues

If installation fails after acceptance:
```json
{
  "status": "failed",
  "providerNotes": "Installation failed. Building requires landlord approval for external wiring. Customer was informed and approved to proceed. Rescheduled for Jan 20 after approvals."
}
```
