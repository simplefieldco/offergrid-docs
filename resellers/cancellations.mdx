## When to Cancel

Common reasons:

- Customer changed mind
- Customer found alternative
- Address error cannot be fixed
- Customer no longer needs service
- Service not available (should be rejected by provider instead)

**Status**: `pending` or `submitted_to_provider`

**Result**: Easy cancellation, no issues

### After Provider Acceptance

**Status**: `accepted`, `scheduled`, or `in_progress`

## Reducing Cancellations

### Pre-Order Checklist

Before submitting:

- [ ] Customer confirmed interest
- [ ] Budget approved
- [ ] Service address verified
- [ ] Availability checked
- [ ] Customer understands timeline
- [ ] Alternative options discussed

### Setting Expectations

Tell customers:
- Typical installation timeline
- What to expect from provider
- Cancellation policies and potential fees
- Installation requirements (home access, etc.)

### Following Up

After order submission:
- Confirm with customer
- Share acceptance notification
- Remind about scheduled appointments
- Be available for questions

## Impact on Your Account

### Metrics Tracked

Providers may monitor:
- **Cancellation rate**: % of orders you cancel
- **Late cancellations**: Cancellations after scheduling
- **Reason patterns**: Common cancellation reasons

### Consequences

High cancellation rates may result in:
- Account review
- Loss of preferred partner status
- Reduced access to exclusive offers
- Commission adjustments

**Target**: Keep cancellation rate below 10%

## When Customer Wants to Cancel Service

If a customer wants to cancel **after service activation**:

1. **Don't use OfferGrid**: Active service cancellation goes through provider
2. **Direct customer to provider**: Give them provider's customer service contact
3. **Not your responsibility**: Once active, it's between customer and provider
4. **Commission implications**: Some providers may claw back commission for early cancellations
