## Overview

Placing orders on OfferGrid is straightforward. Collect the necessary customer information, select services, and submit. Providers handle fulfillment.

## Required Information

Before placing an order, collect:

### Customer Information
- Full name
- Email address
- Phone number

### Service Address
- Street address
- City
- State
- ZIP code
- Country
- Unit/apartment number (if applicable)

### Optional Details
- Customer preferences or notes
- Installation preferences
- Contact time preferences
- Special requirements

<Tip>
  Double-check addresses before submitting. Address errors are the #1 cause of order rejections.
</Tip>

## Placing an Order

### Via Dashboard

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select service">
    Browse catalog and click **Order** on chosen offer
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter customer information">
    Fill in customer name, email, and phone number
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter service address">
    Provide complete service address including unit number

  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and submit">

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Via API

```bash
curl -X POST https://offergrid-api.onrender.com/reseller/orders \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "items": [
      { "offerId": "off-123-abc" }
    ],
    "customerInfo": {
      "fullName": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "phone": "+1-555-123-4567"
    },
    "serviceAddress": {
      "street": "123 Main St",
      "city": "San Francisco",
      "state": "CA",
      "zipCode": "94102",
      "country": "US"
    },
    "notes": "Customer prefers afternoon installations",
    "metadata": {
      "referralSource": "property-listing",
      "unitNumber": "4B"
    }
  }'
```

## Multi-Service Orders

Order multiple services at once:

```json
{
  "items": [
    { "offerId": "internet-offer-id" },
    { "offerId": "tv-offer-id" },
    { "offerId": "security-offer-id" }
  ],
  "customerInfo": { ... },
  "serviceAddress": { ... }
}
```

Each service becomes a separate order item sent to its respective provider.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Verify address format">
    Ensure addresses are complete and properly formatted. Include apartment/unit numbers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use customer's email">
    Use the end customer's contact info, not your own. Providers may need to reach them directly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Add helpful notes">
    Include details that help providers: preferred contact times, gate codes, special access instructions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Confirm before submitting">
    Review all details with customer before placing order. Changes after submission are difficult.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set customer expectations">
    Tell customers when to expect contact from providers (usually 24-48 hours).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## After Submitting

What happens next:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Order created">

  </Step>

  <Step title="Sent to provider">
    Order automatically routed to the service provider
  </Step>

  <Step title="Provider reviews">

  </Step>

  <Step title="Customer contacted">
    If accepted, provider contacts customer to schedule
  </Step>

  <Step title="Service installed">
    Provider completes installation and activates service
  </Step>
