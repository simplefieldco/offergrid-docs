## Understanding Offer Visibility

You can only see offers that:
- Are marked as `active` by the provider
- Are either:
  - Public (visible to all resellers)
  - Preferred-only AND you're on that provider's preferred list
  - Selected resellers AND you're specifically added

<Note>
  Your access level affects which offers you see. Build strong relationships with providers to gain access to exclusive offerings.
