### Don't Share Without Permission

- Customer data is for order fulfillment only
- Don't sell or share customer lists
- Don't use customer emails for marketing without opt-in
- Follow all applicable privacy laws

## Validating Customer Data

### Pre-Submission Checks

```typescript
function validateCustomerInfo(customerInfo) {
  const errors = [];

  // Name validation
  if (!customerInfo.fullName || customerInfo.fullName.trim().length < 3) {
    errors.push('Full name is required');
  }

  // Email validation
  const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  if (!emailRegex.test(customerInfo.email)) {
    errors.push('Valid email is required');
  }

  // Phone validation
  const phoneRegex = /^\+?[\d\s\-\(\)]+$/;
  if (!phoneRegex.test(customerInfo.phone) || customerInfo.phone.replace(/\D/g, '').length < 10) {
    errors.push('Valid 10-digit phone number is required');
  }

  return errors;
}

function validateServiceAddress(address) {
  const errors = [];

  if (!address.street) errors.push('Street address is required');
  if (!address.city) errors.push('City is required');
  if (!address.state) errors.push('State is required');
  if (!address.zipCode) errors.push('ZIP code is required');
  if (!address.country) errors.push('Country is required');

  return errors;
}
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Using your own contact info">
    **Wrong**: Using reseller email/phone

    **Right**: Using customer's actual contact info

    Why: Providers need to reach the customer directly for scheduling and support.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Incomplete addresses">
    **Wrong**: Missing unit numbers, abbreviated city names

    **Right**: Complete address with all components

    Why: Address errors cause order rejections and delays.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Invalid phone numbers">
    **Wrong**: Local number without area code, international number without country code

    **Right**: Full phone number with proper formatting

    Why: Providers can't schedule without valid contact number.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Temporary email addresses">
    **Wrong**: Using disposable or temporary email addresses

    **Right**: Customer's permanent email address

    Why: Customers need ongoing access for account management and billing.
