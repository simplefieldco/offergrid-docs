</Warning>

## Commission Considerations

Balance commission with customer needs:

**High commission offers** might be:
- Right for the customer (premium services they'll use)
- Wrong for the customer (overpriced for their needs)

**Build long-term relationships** by:
- Prioritizing customer fit over commission
- Being transparent about tradeoffs
- Following up after installation

<Tip>
  Happy customers lead to referrals and repeat business. Don't sacrifice customer satisfaction for short-term commission gains.
