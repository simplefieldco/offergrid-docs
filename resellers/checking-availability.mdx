## Overview

Not all services are available everywhere. Always check availability before presenting options to avoid customer disappointment and order rejections.

## Checking via ZIP Code

### Dashboard

1. Go to **Catalog**
2. Enter ZIP code in the search filter
3. View only services available in that area

### API

```bash
GET /reseller/catalog?zipCode=94102
```

Returns only offers available at that ZIP code.

<Tip>
  Always filter by ZIP code first, then show customers their available options.
</Tip>

## Understanding Service Areas

### ZIP Code Boundaries

- Some providers serve entire ZIP codes
- Others serve partial ZIP codes
- Always verify specific addresses

### Technology Availability

**Fiber**: Limited to areas with fiber infrastructure
**Cable**: Widely available in urban/suburban areas
**DSL**: Available where phone lines exist
**Wireless**: Coverage based on tower proximity
**Satellite**: Available almost everywhere

## Address-Specific Verification

### When ZIP Code Isn't Enough

Some situations require address-level verification:

- Multi-dwelling units (apartments, condos)
- Rural areas with sparse coverage
- New construction or recently developed areas
- Edge of service area boundaries

### How to Verify

**During order placement**:
- Submit the order with full address details
- Provider will accept or reject based on serviceability
- Wait for provider confirmation before promising customer

**Before order placement** (if available):
- Contact provider support for pre-qualification
- Use provider's own serviceability check
- Ask about building-specific requirements

## Common Availability Issues

### Not in Service Area

**Problem**: Address is outside provider's coverage

**Solution**:
- Try alternative providers
- Check if service area is expanding
- Consider different technology types

### Building Restrictions

**Problem**: HOA, landlord, or building policies prevent installation

**Customer should**:
- Check with property management
- Review HOA rules
- Get written approval if needed

**You should**:
- Note restrictions in order
- Alert provider in advance
- Set customer expectations

### Technical Limitations

**Problem**: Physical obstacles prevent service

Examples:
- No line of sight for satellite/wireless
- Building wiring doesn't support fiber
- Distance from telephone exchange (DSL)

**Solution**:
- Provider will identify during site survey
- Present alternative technologies
- Set realistic expectations upfront

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Always start with ZIP code">
    Never show customers offers without checking ZIP code availability first.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Collect full address early">
    Get complete address including unit number, building name, etc.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set expectations about confirmation">
    Tell customers that final availability is confirmed by the provider during order review.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Have backup options ready">
    If first choice isn't available, have alternatives from other providers or technologies.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Note building types">
    Single-family homes rarely have issues. Apartments, condos, and commercial buildings may require special approval.

## Communicating Availability to Customers

### When Service IS Available

"Great news! [Service Name] is available at your address. The provider offers [speeds/features] for $[price]/month."

### When Service Might Be Available

"This service appears to be available in your ZIP code, but the provider will need to verify your specific address. I'll submit the order and they'll confirm within 24 hours."

### When Service Is NOT Available

"Unfortunately, [Service Name] isn't available at your address yet. However, I found [Alternative Service] which offers similar features..."
