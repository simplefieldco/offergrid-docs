## Platform Overview

Offergrid is a B2B marketplace that streamlines the distribution and sale of essential services. We connect service providers (internet, TV, security, energy, insurance companies) with reseller partners who help customers find and purchase these services.

## For Service Providers

### Create and Manage Offers

Providers publish their service offerings with pricing, availability, and detailed specifications. Control who can see your offers and manage multiple service categories from a single platform.

### Receive Orders

When resellers place orders on behalf of customers, you receive them instantly with all necessary customer information for fulfillment.

### Fulfill and Track

Update order status through the fulfillment workflow—from acceptance to scheduling, installation, and activation. Keep resellers informed every step of the way.

## For Resellers

### Browse the Catalog

Search and filter available service offerings by category, price, location, and features. Compare multiple providers to find the best fit for your customers.

### Place Orders

Submit orders with customer details and service addresses. Orders are automatically routed to the appropriate providers for fulfillment.

### Track Progress

Monitor order status in real-time as providers accept, schedule, and complete installations. Keep your customers informed throughout the process.
