## Welcome

The Offergrid API is a B2B marketplace API that connects service providers with reseller partners. It streamlines the distribution and sale of essential services like internet, TV, security, energy, and insurance.

With the Offergrid API, you can:

- **Manage Service Offerings**: Create, update, retrieve, and delete service offers for your team
- **Partner Links**: Manage partner links and distribution channels
- **Automate Distribution**: Integrate your service catalog with reseller networks

## Base URL

The API is available at the following base URLs:

- **Production**: `https://api.offergrid.io`
- **Local Development**: `http://localhost:3000`

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using a **Team API Key**. Include your team API key in the request headers for every API call.

### Using the Team API Key

Add the following header to your requests:

```
x-api-key: YOUR_TEAM_API_KEY
```

### Example Request

Here's an example of making an authenticated request using cURL:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.offergrid.io/offers \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_TEAM_API_KEY"
```

### Getting Your API Key

To obtain your team API key, please contact your Offergrid administrator or visit your team settings in the Offergrid dashboard.

<Warning>
  Keep your API key secure and never expose it in client-side code or public repositories. Treat it like a password.
